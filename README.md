# Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis
Data cleaning and Analysis of Ebay Car Sales from 90's to 2016
In this project, I worked with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website. The dataset was originaly scraped and uploaded to Kaggle.

The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings using pandas library.
